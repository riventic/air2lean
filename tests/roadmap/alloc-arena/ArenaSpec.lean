# The translated `ArenaAllocator`'s `free`, `resize` and `remap` against `FAllocSpec`

`free_spec`, `resize_spec`, `remap_spec`: the entries of the translated `std.heap.ArenaAllocator`
(Zig 0.16.0, x86_64-linux, `AllocArena/ArenaLinux.lean`) meet `FAllocSpec`'s contracts for the
arena invariant `inv CI γ e ctx` below, read in the caller's thread (`CTriple`, `Sched.soloRun`),
from the generated code only. No model of the arena is used. `alloc` is not here: the stock arena
does not meet `FAllocSpec`'s `alloc` field for any child (O-E, O-B in `docs/alloc-arena.md`).

**The invariant** `own CI γ e ctx` (for a child allocator `CI : Child`: its invariant, context
pointer `CI.cctx` and vtable `CI.vtp` with entries `CI.fns`; ghost name `γ`, epoch `e`):

* the arena struct at `ctx`: the child allocator (16 bytes `CI.bytes`: `cctx` and `vtp`, not read
  here) and the child's vtable as persistent knowledge (`vtR`), `used_list` and `free_list` as
  pointer-valued atomic words (`aptsE`);
* the ghost authority `gauthP γ e M CI.tag`: the grant map `M` of epoch `e`, grant id ↦ region
  and lent fraction (`docs/sep-full-state.md` §Ghost state), under the child's tag;
* the first node of `used_list`, if any (`FirstPart`): its header words (`size` and `end_index`
  atomic, `next` plain), the unused tail of its buffer (from `end_index` on), the child's token
  for the node and the part of the node's extent share that the arena keeps; the other used nodes
  (`rest`, a list of node records `NodeV`) and the free list (`Chain`): headers, tokens and
  shares, the free nodes with their whole buffers;
* the child's state `CI.own`, the junk `JunkAt jh` (bytes that frees which were not the last
  allocation, shrinks and padding leaked back; the arena never touches them until `reset`), one
  receipt per grant (`Rcpts`) and the shares that frees gave back (`Pool`).

With no first node, `M` is empty. Every byte of a used node's buffer is in the junk's heap `jh`,
in a grant, or in the first node's unused tail (`OV.Cov`), which `reset` needs to give each node
back whole. Every grant lies in the block of a used node, with that node's
address and kind labels, at a nonnegative offset (`GrantOk`). A token for the slice `(p, n)` with
cell labels `A`, `K` is `gfrag γ e i (p, n, q, A, K)` for some grant id `i`, with the fraction `q`
of the grant's extent share (tagged `(γ, e)`): it names exactly that region, so a token of the
current epoch shows `M i = some (p, n, q, A, K)` (`gfrag_mem`), hence a first node: **O-A is excluded by ghost state**, not by a premise, and a `free` of a slice
that this arena did not grant has no token: a permission violation. A token of an older epoch
(after `reset`) is stale: it belongs to `inv … e'` for `e' < e`, whose `own` needs the authority
of epoch `e'`, which no longer exists.

**`free`** loads the first node, compares `buf + end_index` with the slice's end by address
(`ptrEqAddr`), and on a match moves `end_index` back by a strong `cmpxchg`. The comparison is
decided by the blocks and offsets (O-F, `last_dec`): the node and the slice reach their ends by
their extent shares (`Holds.pshareW`), and two live blocks share no byte address
(`Mem.LiveDisjoint.addr_ne`); a slice of the node's block that ends at `buf + end_index` carries
the node's labels (`last_labels`) and lies past the header, which the arena owns (`lo_of`). On a match the slice's bytes rejoin the tail; otherwise (a grant that is not the last
one) they become junk. Either way the grant's share goes back against its receipt into the pool
and the grant is retired (`free_ghost`).

**`resize`** meets the refined contract (`FAllocSpec.resize`, `docs/sep-full-state.md`
§`FAllocSpec` refined): the client gives the token, a part `q'` of the grant's share and only the
bytes a shrink releases. It has the same prefix. A slice that is not the first node's last one only
shrinks (the released bytes become junk); the last one moves `end_index` back (a shrink: the
released bytes rejoin the tail) or forward into the tail when it has room (`Node.loadBuf` reads
the `size` word: `FTriple.atomicLoadAs`, `toInt_ofBits`): the client gets the new bytes with its
labels, and its part of the share is re-lent at the new end against a split receipt
(`rcpt_regrow`: `brcpt_split`, `EUpd.returnTw`, `EUpd.lendT`, `EUpd.rjoin`). A successful
resize re-points the grant at the new length (`Upd.reassign`; `shrink_ghost`, `grow_ghost`).
**`remap`** is `resize` (the whole-region form, `FAllocInv.resize_granted_of`) and returns
`memory.ptr`.

**O-E** (`ArenaObstruction.oob_free_illegal`): the invariant keeps `end_index` within the first
node's buffer (`OV.Facts`: `24 + ei ≤ sz`). A failed `alloc` leaves it past the buffer, so the reachable
states this specification covers end at the first failed `alloc`.
