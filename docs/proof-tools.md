# Separation proof tools

Import `ZigLean.Sep.Automation` for `sep_normalize` and `sep_frame`. Import
`ZigLean.Sep.Total` for total-correctness rules. These are optional modules;
existing generated-code imports and `Triple` keep their current meaning.

`sep_normalize` rewrites assertion expressions with associativity, commutativity,
and the `emp` unit. It also accepts ordinary Lean locations, for example
`sep_normalize at hp ⊢`. The resulting simp proofs use proved assertion equalities;
the tactic does not extend the trusted kernel or execute a decision procedure.

`sep_frame rule` closes a `Triple` goal by inferring the unused atoms in the
goal's precondition, applying `Triple.frame`, and checking both consequences by
normalization. With `open Zig Assn`, for example:

```lean
example (P Q R : Assn) (c : MemM Unit)
    (rule : Triple P c (fun _ => Q)) :
    Triple (R ∗ P) c (fun _ => Q ∗ R) := by
  sep_frame rule
```

Separating atoms are opaque; candidate matching uses definitional equality.
Repeated atoms are counted separately. A missing atom, a changed command, or an
incorrect postcondition causes failure. Final proof checking uses Lean's standard
simp ordering, which can fail to align definitionally equal wrapper atoms or
atoms differing only in implicit typeclass instances. In those cases, first
rewrite wrappers explicitly or apply the separation equalities directly. This
is AC/unit simplification and syntactic frame
inference: it does not split byte ranges or arrays, choose existential witnesses,
discharge arithmetic, or synthesize loop invariants. It is a bounded part of P01.

`TotalTriple P c Q` requires an explicit `c.run m = pure (v, m')` witness for
every admissible sequential input and disjoint frame, along with ownership of
`Q v` and preservation of the frame. Divergence and safety panics cannot satisfy
this equality. An unsatisfiable precondition remains vacuous, as with ordinary
Hoare logic. Zig error-union values such as `OutOfMemory` remain return values.

`TotalTriple.toPartial` projects ordinary partial correctness. Conversely,
`TotalTriple.of_partial` additionally requires `Returns P c`; partial correctness
alone never establishes termination. The API includes consequence, frame, return,
bind, existential/pure-precondition rules, load/store, array store, and
`TotalTriple.loop_ghost`. The loop rule requires a natural-number measure that
strictly decreases on each repeat, through the existing `loop_sep_ghost` theorem.
It does not provide concurrency termination or a general recursive-call rule.
This is an honest total/partial interface and a bounded contribution to P05.

The regression files in `tests/roadmap/proof-tools/` check AC normalization,
unit/duplicate handling, rejected framing, array mutation with inferred frames,
total bind, rejection of divergence/panics, and explicit conversion between
partial and total correctness. Once modules are built, run each with `lake env
lean tests/roadmap/proof-tools/<name>.lean` (`Normalize`, `Clients`, and `Total`).
