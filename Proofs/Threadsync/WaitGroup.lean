# `threadsync.waitGroup` over all schedules

`waitGroup` starts a `Thread.WaitGroup` with 2, spawns two tasks and waits on the group. Each
task adds 1 to a counter under a `Thread.Mutex` and finishes the group; the last one to finish
after `main` began to wait sets the group's `Thread.ResetEvent`. Then `main` reads the counter
(0.15.2 reads the whole `Tally` struct) and joins the tasks. All sync objects are translated from
Zig 0.15.2's std code (Linux); the futex under them is the model. The result is 2 under every
schedule (`waitGroup_spec`), and no schedule gives an error (`waitGroup_safe`).

The mutex (bytes 16..20 of the `Tally`, block 0) is a lock that owns the counter (bytes 20..24,
`R`; contended value 3). The group's state (a `u64`, bytes 0..8) and the event's state (bytes
8..12) are shared atomic words. This file proves the rest:

- **Ghost values** (`Gh = LG × X`): the lock's part, the thread's place (`Ph`), and for a task its
  clock after its finish (`fc`), its clock after its last access to the `Tally` (`fz`, when it is
  `frozen`) and whether it set the event (`sx`).
- **The writes**: the group's state is `4 + 1 (main waits) - 2 (each finish)`, and its newest
  write's release clock is above each finish (`gw`). The event's writes are `0`, `1` (`main`) and
  `2` (the setter, `ev`); the set happened after the clocks of both tasks (`setc`).
- **`main`'s read**: when `main` stops waiting, both tasks are `frozen` and their clocks are below
  `main`'s (`done`). Each access to the `Tally` is by a thread and below its clock, or its frozen
  clock (`attr`). So `main`'s read of the whole `Tally` does not race. The tasks are `gone` for the
  lock after their finish, so the read keeps the lock's invariant (`Lock.Inv.readAll`).
